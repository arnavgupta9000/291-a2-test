Details: The thought process for this one was we need cs students so set facilty to 'CS'. We also need books with authors that HAVE john/marry in their name and hence we can use the % wildcard operator before and after to ensure we get that result. We can wrap bo.auhtor in lower ... lower(bo.author) to ensure the "All text matches should be case-insensitive." b.book_id = bo.book_id and b.member = m.email; are what links the tables together to get the information we want. Ultimatley I came up with  select distinct bid, email, end_date from borrowings b, members m, books bo where m.faculty = 'CS' and (lower(bo.author) like '%john%' or lower(bo.author) like '%marry%') and b.book_id = bo.book_id and b.member = m.email; where distinct is required for no duplicates (as in last question).
