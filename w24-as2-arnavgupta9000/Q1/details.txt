Details: I started with  select distinct name, email from members m, waitlists w where m.email = b.member and w.member = m.email not realizing about the waitlist. I came to this conclusion using the slides for the basic structure, distinct to not repeat tuples (like in the query above) where m.email = b.member connected the 2 tables. I later realized that I was missing waitlist entirely so then I modified my query to select distinct name, email from members m, borrowings b, waitlists w where m.email = b.member and w.member = m.email and w.edate not null; which worked! the w.edate not null is to make sure they actually have gotten the book they waitlisted.
