Details  select distinct bo.book_id, title, (select count(*)from borrowings b where b.book_id = bo.book_id) as amount from borrowings b, books bo where pyear <= 2015 and amount * 2 > (select count(*) from waitlists w where w.book_id = bo.book_id); This one was MUCH EASIER then the last 2. I also had a discovery where if you put a 2nd select clause in the select itll print that result no matter what. for ex select distinct bo.book_id, title, author,  (select count(*)from borrowings b where b.book_id = bo.book_id) as borrow <- from Q4 thatll always print borrow so I had to modify my code so that the second select statment had a > sign has to not print the result. Other than that the  (select count(*) from waitlists w where w.book_id = bo.book_id) was used directly from q4 and pyear <=2015 is a req. the amount * 2 < {second select here as mentioned above} is another req and thus forms my full query.
