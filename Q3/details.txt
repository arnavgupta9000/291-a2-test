Details: First thing we check is that end date is not null. This is to ensure no errors (not sure if there would be any with the julianday function but better safe) BUT mainly since if they havent returned it, then we dont need to consider it.  julianday(b.end_date) - julianday(b.start_date) > 14 checks for if they have had it for more than 14 days since that is a requirement. Priority greater than OR EQAUL to 5 since that is another req.  bo.book_id = b.book_id; is the joining req. putting it all together we get  select distinct bid, email from members m, borrowings b, waitlists w, books bo where end_date not null and m.email = b.member and julianday(b.end_date) - julianday(b.start_date) > 14 and priority >= 5 and bo.book_id = b.book_id; where distinct makes sure no 2 tuples if identical are returned are displayed.
